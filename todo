==============
Question 1:  Receiving Financial Support?  Yes   No
Question 2:  Current Student?   Yes   No

Sub Menu options vary depending how they answer those TWO  questions.

If Yes Yes - I guess it would enter automatically “Currently Sponsored” and then they would need to be offered a sub-menu for them to choose the  Level of Support such as  Full/Part/One off Donation etc...

If No Yes - then they get the Gap Year / Other options

If No No - they get the Graduated more than 2 years ago, sponsorship withdrawn, expiry of one off donation options.
