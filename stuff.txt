jnlp:
need to sign jars:
javafxpackager -signJar --outdir /home/orenberenson/kesho/project/ui/target/jfx/app/dist -keyStore testKeys -storePass berenson -alias jdc -srcdir /home/orenberenson/kesho/project/ui/target/jfx/app/dist

run javafxpackager and then jarsigner for each jar that seemed to be unsigned: jarsigner -keystore testKeys aspectjrt-1.7.2.jar jdc

dialogs not showing images

native app:
to create dmg need to run on mac
copy dmg file when dialog to install app open


To install standalone app(I hope these are the correct steps):
1) double click the dmg file
2) drag to Application folder
3) Go to Application folder and double click kesho1 app (It will not open at this time)
4) The first attempt should have created a folder db/db under your home directory. If you are not sure about your home directory, open terminal and type pwd.
5) Copy the attached script to [home dir]/db/db
6) re launch kesho1 application
